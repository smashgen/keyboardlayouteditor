# Introduction #

Download the source code from the repository. Currently you need a Subversion (SVN) client to download the files. This is a hint for me to add a package in the Downloads section.

# Details #

  * Once you unpack the archive, enter the src/ subdirectory, and run the program **./KeyboardLayoutEditor**.
  * You probably need to install some additional support packages. When you run the program from command line, you should be advised on which package is missing. You normally need to install files that have "python" in their name, and the word that is shown in the error message. Once I get a fresh installation of Linux, I'll try and see which are the common packages that are required.
  * You also need to install the Antlr runtime for Python. See http://code.google.com/p/keyboardlayouteditor/source/browse/trunk/KeyboardLayoutEditor/README.txt for more
